## Human model learning from RGB with depth assistance
 We propose RGB-D based self supervised training of a deep network that (i) learns to predict the pose parameters of a human from an RGB image. (ii) learns to regress shape and person specific shape displacements which enables use of the method for scale-aware 3D reconstruction task. Check out the project [here](/projects/HumanModelLearning/)

## Extending PointNet for Localization

## Human Performance Capture system using Depth Based Trackers

## Classification and Pose Estimation using CNN and Triplet Loss

## Interactive 3D shape deformation using ARAP

## Density based Traffic Control System using Image Processing
